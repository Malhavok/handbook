## (out of date) Job Offer: Junior E-commerce Specialist

By Malvy is an up-and-coming luxury e-commerce brand created for women by women. **We are now looking for a Junior E-commerce Specialist to join the company and perform a variety of tasks to support the CEO in developing the brand.**

Managing an e-commerce business includes many different responsibilities. Some of them are absolutely necessary but too time-consuming for the CEO to deal with them herself. And that is where you come in. We need someone to maintain close contact with the CEO, Malwina, and take care of the everyday operations of by Malvy.

We are **100% remote**, and that applies to you, too. You’ll be free to work from wherever you want to, as long as it doesn’t interfere with your work duties.

As a Junior E-commerce Specialist, you can expect to learn a lot about the  everyday functioning of an e-commerce business, enjoy a close collaboration with experienced entrepreneurs, and have a significant impact on the brand.

**Some of your main obligations would be to:**
- Run everyday operations of the e-commerce business based on the Shoplo platform and, in the future, possibly Amazon. This includes managing orders, contacting customers, and configuring the platform.
- Upload posts to social media (Facebook and Instagram) and interact with fans.
- Create basic graphics in Canva for use on social media and on the company website,
- Research materials and services.
- Contact suppliers.
- Perform general research.

The description is slightly vague by design – we need someone to deal with both repetitive tasks and ad-hoc solutions for the everyday functioning of the company. The work responsibilities are diverse, but not overly difficult. You won’t have to deal with technical problems – if they arise, they’ll get solved by our IT professionals.

**We are looking for someone who satisfies the following requirements:**
- **Fluent English & Polish (B2 level) are indispensable** – we sell to the whole of Europe and use English to communicate with our customers. The website and social media are all in English. Polish is essential to contact suppliers via phone/email.
- **A smart, respectful, and concise communicator** – we work remotely, so precise communication is of great importance.
- **A responsible and independent worker** – we respect each other’s time and keep our commitments, and we expect you to do the same. You should know how to self-regulate your work in a remote environment. We are looking for someone whose presence will bring order and not chaos. Everyone makes mistakes, but we expect you to focus and make sure not to repeat them.
- **A resourceful and active learner** – you’ll need to use many different tools, and Google will be one of the most important. You need to be an efficient researcher and enjoy getting to know new things. We appreciate people who are always looking for methods to improve the way they work, and even the way the whole company works. One area that you might pursue in this role if you want to is that of a Performance Marketer.
- **Not afraid of basic digital tools** – you will definitely need to use Google Sheets, Google Docs, Slack, Trello, Hubstaff, and probably many other websites and applications. We don’t expect you to be a fluent user of all programs that we happen to use at the company, but we’re looking for someone who’s not afraid to learn new tools and simply Google things when not sure what to click.

**What do we bring to the table?**
- You can expect lots of **independence**. You don’t need to commute anywhere, and we don’t have a dress code. This job is **100% remote**. We mostly work **asynchronously**. While some tasks may need to be done at a certain time or you may need to arrange a call with someone at a set hour, in general, you will **not** need to work “9 to 5”.
- The job can be combined with university or other obligations. For now, we’re only looking to hire someone for about **60 hours per month**, calculated by a time-tracker. 
- We are offering **a stable, long-term collaboration** via contract of mandate (umowa zlecenie).
- You can **learn a lot.** The company collaborates with experts in their respective fields, and you can be sure to pick up a lot of business know-how by participating in all kinds of activities.
- **Your voice counts.** The company is small, and everyone hates bureaucracy at an equal level. You will enjoy a close working relationship with the CEO, and you are more than allowed to bring up your concerns or come up with new ways to improve the way we do things.

You don’t need to send us your CV – it’s enough if you fill out our survey (out of date, Junior E-commerce Specialist has been found) and tell us a little about yourself.
