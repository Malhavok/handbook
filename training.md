# what is this about

When you join the company, we need to bring you up to our level (or you need to bring us to your level ;) ). Best way we found, is to make you watch some videos from conferences, so here they are. Bill the time spent doing this on `INTERNAL / training`, put the title of the movie into the work subject note.

You don't need to see all of it in one go. Instead, use it to tune the speed of your initial transition into the project. If the transition is quick (you are heavily coding on your first day), slow it down and watch some training material. If the transition is slow due to questions, timezones, environment issues, other kind of blocking issues, then report those, and watch some training material. You are expected to see everything that matches your position within two weeks from starting the work with the company.
