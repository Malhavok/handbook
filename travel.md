### Serbia

They only accept local currency there. You can get some at the airport ATM provided that you request something that is divisible by 500 dinar. Consider using a revolut card.

No running in Serbia. If you try to run, some random person on the street will tackle you - apparently the only people who run there are thiefs immediately after committing a crime.

We ate a small Pleskavica in GASTROTEKA, Belgrade, everyone enjoyed it, it's recommended.

When you exit the customs at the airport, turn right and backwards (so you are walking away from the ATM), you can buy a local sim card with plenty of data for ~3 euro.

Do not use local taxis, use a Car:go mobile application to keep the costs reasonable.
